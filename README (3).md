## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Ashken Soriano**, a passionate game developer

## About Me

I am currently in the early stages of my programming journey. Iâ€™m still building my confidence, so Iâ€™m focused on exploring different tools and concepts and slowly understanding how they work in real situations. I also create other assets and 3D models using Blender, although I havenâ€™t fully explored it yet. My goal for now is to gradually develop a solid foundation before moving on to more advanced projects.
