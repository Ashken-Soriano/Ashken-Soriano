## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Ashken Soriano**, a passionate game developer

## About Me

Iâ€™m still at the beginning of my programming journey, and Iâ€™m not really good at it yet â€” but I do understand a little and Iâ€™m continuously learning. Right now Iâ€™m mostly exploring different tools and concepts to slowly get a feel for how they work in real situations. I also create assets and 3D models using Blender, although I havenâ€™t fully explored that either. For now, my goal is to gradually build a solid foundation before eventually moving on to more advanced projects.
